# Callbacks

The exercise gets you to use callbacks. Here is an example of a callback in action:

```javascript
function doHomework (subject, callback) {
  alert(`Starting my ${subject} homework.`)
  callback()
}

doHomework('math', function () {
  alert('Finished my homework')
})
```

## Exercise

Open up `03.js`. Call the provided function with a callback.

## Extra Credit

If you get this far, see if you can draw down how the event loop works in Javascript.

ðŸ˜´ After that take a well deserved break
