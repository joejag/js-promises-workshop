# Blocking and predicting timeouts

Have a try at using this site which simulates what happens when you do heavy work that blocks the event loop:

http://rauschma.github.io/async-examples/blocking.html

How have they managed to simulate the blocking behaviour?

## Exercise

Open up `01.js`. Try to predict what the code will output before running it. Is it consistent?
