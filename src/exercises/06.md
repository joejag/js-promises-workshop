# Handling state

So far we've avoided state by calling functions that have side effects.

Usually when you are calling functions it's to get some result then perform another action.

In this example our callbacks start using the normal convention of returning two arguments: error | result

```js
function aFn (callback) {
  callback(null, previous + ' ' + current) // the first argument being null means there is no error
}

aFn((err, result) => console.log(result))
```

## Exercise

Open up `06.js`. We are now calling functions in the three different styles to see how they feel.
